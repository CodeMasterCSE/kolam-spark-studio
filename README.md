- **Multiple Symmetry Types**: Mirror, rotational (8-way), radial, and freeform patterns
- **Smooth Animations**: Beautiful transitions and drawing animations
- **Pattern Download**: Export your creations as PNG files
- **Cultural Design**: Traditional Indian color palette with maroon, gold, and cream tones
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## üé® Design System

- **Colors**: Traditional Indian palette with warm maroons, golds, and creams
- **Typography**: Cultural-inspired headings with gradient text effects
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions using Framer Motion
- **UI Components**: Custom shadcn/ui components with cultural theming

## üöÄ Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **HTML5 Canvas** for pattern rendering
- **shadcn/ui** component library
- **Lucide React** for icons

## üîß Pattern Generation

The app uses advanced algorithms to generate authentic Kolam patterns:

- **8-way Rotational Symmetry**: Based on traditional mathematical principles
- **Procedural Generation**: Each pattern is unique with seed-based reproducibility
- **Sacred Geometry**: Honors traditional Indian geometric art forms
- **Adaptive Complexity**: Patterns range from simple to highly intricate

## üì± Usage

1. Adjust the **Grid Size** to change pattern density
2. Modify **Dot Spacing** for pattern scale
3. Select **Symmetry Type** for different pattern styles
4. Control **Complexity** from simple to intricate designs
5. Click **Generate Kolam** to create new patterns
6. **Download** your favorite patterns as PNG files
